## 2026-09-03 — Batch 2: posting core contracts

**Objective.** Execute one `run-batch-cycle` iteration: triage the remaining issues, implement the
single best next batch, review it, and stop.

**Changes made.**

- Triaged 89 open issues. Phase 2 (Foundational, 21 tasks) is too large for one PR and decomposes
  into four independent concerns: posting core contracts, settings, logging, orchestrator. The
  first three are mutually independent; the orchestrator depends on all three.
- Selected and implemented **Batch 2 — posting core contracts** (T006-T010, issues #7-#11):
  `Message` + `Validate`, `SinkResult` + `AllSucceeded`, the two-method `Sink` interface, and
  table-driven tests.
- Applied two authorized review fix passes to `internal/post/result.go` and `result_test.go`.
- Committed as `447cf53`; pushed; opened PR #97, merged to `main` as `3214bbd`.
- Filed issue #98 recording the note-event ownership decision.

**Evidence.**

- `make check` (gofmt + `go vet ./...` + `go test -race ./...`) clean; `go build ./...` clean.
- 10 top-level tests, 86 subtests in `internal/post`.
- Bot-token leak surface: verb sweep across 52 letters x 5 flag sets went from **205/260 leaking**
  to **0/260**; slog JSON and Text handlers, `json.Marshal` and all `fmt` surfaces clean.
- Staged review across 3 cycles (contract / correctness / adversarial each cycle), 2 fix passes.
  Terminal verdict `passed-with-notes`: 0 blockers, 0 should-fix.
- Full review state under `~/.agents/review-runs/sgykfjsm__miko-post/20260902T040356Z-79b5bd57/`.

**Decisions.**

1. `AllSucceeded(nil)` is `false`, not vacuously `true` — fail-closed on the exit status.
2. `SinkResult` gained five render guards after review found a real leak: the Telegram sink puts
   the bot token in the request path, so `net/http` returns a `*url.Error` carrying it, and `%v`
   plus `json.Marshal` printed it verbatim. Chose redaction guards over unexporting `Err`.
3. Note events keep orchestrator ownership; the sink exposes its target (issue #98).
4. `Message` gets no rune/byte accessors — follows T006/T072 over `data-model.md`.

**Blockers and open questions.**

- Six non-blocking review follow-ups were accepted but **not filed as issues**; they exist only in
  the review run state named above. Highest-value: `xml.Marshal` still reaches `Err`; the
  method-enumeration test skips argument-taking methods and logs the skip invisibly under
  `make check`; the `%p` residual relies on an unenforced "every error is a pointer" invariant that
  belongs in T056's acceptance notes.
- `data-model.md` is stale in two places (the `SinkResult` entity omits the render guards; the
  empty-slice decision is recorded only in a Go doc comment). Both for spec-reconciler at close.
- Issue #94 (`git_commit` is `unknown` on tagged installs) remains an open maintainer decision,
  needed before `v0.1.0` is tagged.

**Next best action.** Run `run-batch-cycle` for Batch 3 — Settings (T011-T020, issues #12-#21).
